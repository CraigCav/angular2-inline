## language-vscode-javascript-angular2
This package is a language extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code.  It extends the javascript and
typescript colorizers to add Angular2 specific highlighting for inline templates and stylesheets.

When you define an inline template or inline style sheet using the backtick character(`` ` ``) the
content will be highlighted.

Below is an example of what the colorizer looks like in action.

This extension uses grammar files that are in part derived from the grammar files found within
the [vscode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) project.
