## language-vscode-javascript-angular2
This package is a language extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code.  It extends the javascript colorizer so that text that appears within 
`` (` `` and `` `) `` characters will be highlighted similar to how JSX syntax gets highlighted.

Below is an example of what the colorizer looks like in action.
